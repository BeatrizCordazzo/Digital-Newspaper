        <p><strong>The Rafah border crossing with Egypt in the southern Gaza Strip opened on Saturday to allow aid trucks to enter Gaza for the first time since the Israel-Hamas war erupted.</strong></p>
        <p>Israel has so far agreed to allow 20 trucks into Gaza from Egypt carrying food, water and medicine, but not fuel. It was not clear how long the border would remain open. Palestinians had been gathering at the crossing in recent days in the hope of leaving ahead of an expected Israeli ground offensive.</p>
        <h2>What is the Rafah crossing?</h2>
        <p>It's the southernmost post of exit from Gaza and borders Egypt's Sinai peninsula. There are only two other border crossings from and into the Gaza Strip - Erez, a crossing for people with Israel in northern Gaza, and Kerem Shalom, a solely commercial goods junction with Israel in southern Gaza. Both are shut.</p>
        <h2>Why is it important now?</h2>
        <p>Gunmen from the Palestinian militant group Hamas, which governs Gaza, attacked the Erez crossing on 7 October during an unprecedented assault on southern Israel which killed more than 1,300 people.  Days later, Israel declared Erez and Kerem Shalom closed until further notice, leaving the Rafah border as the only way into and out of the Strip for people.  Rafah is now also the only crossing point for humanitarian aid.  Last week, the Egyptian foreign ministry said it was directing international aid flights for Gaza to El-Arish airport in northern Sinai, and dozens of lorries carrying fuel and humanitarian goods are parked on the Egyptian side of the Rafah crossing.</p>
