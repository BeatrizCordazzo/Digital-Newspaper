                <p><strong>The Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking more than 220 hostages.</strong></p>
                <p>Gaza's health ministry says more than 5,000 people have been killed in the territory since Israel launched retaliatory air strikes, and a ground offensive is expected.</p>

                <figcaption>West Antarctica — home to the Thwaites Glacier, also known as the "Doomsday glacier" — is the continent's largest contributor to global sea level rise.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Rapid melting of <strong>West Antarctica's ice shelves</strong> may now be unavoidable as human-caused global warming accelerates, with potentially devastating implications for sea level rise around the world, new research has found. Even if the world meets ambitious targets to limit global heating, West Antarctica will experience substantial ocean warming and ice shelf melting, according to the new study published Monday in the journal Nature Climate Change. Ice shelves are tongues of ice that jut out into the ocean at the end of glaciers. They act like buttresses, helping hold ice back on the land, slowing its flow into the sea and providing an important defense against sea level rise. As ice shelves melt, they thin and lose their buttressing ability.</p>
            <p>While there has been growing evidence ice loss in West Antarctica may be irreversible, there has been uncertainty about how much can be prevented through climate policies. The researchers looked at “basal melting,” when warm ocean currents melt the ice from beneath. They analyzed the rate of ocean warming and ice shelf melting under different climate change scenarios. These ranged from the ambitious, where the world manages to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, to the worst-case, where humans burn large amounts of planet-heating fossil fuels. <br> They found if the world limits temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius, which it is not on track to do, climate change could still cause the ocean to warm at three times the historical rate. Even significantly cutting planet-heating pollution now will have “limited power” to prevent warmer oceans from triggering the collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet, the report found. <em>“It appears that we may have lost control of the West Antarctic ice melting over the 21st century,”</em> said Kaitlin Naughten, an ocean modeler with the British Antarctic Survey and lead author of the study.</p>

            <p>A <strong>JetBlue</strong> passenger jet lost its balance and tipped like a seesaw while unloading Sunday at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport, according to the airline. <em>“Once at the gate, due to a shift in weight and balance during deplaning, the tail of the aircraft tipped backward causing the nose of the aircraft to lift up and eventually return back down,”</em> JetBlue told CNN. Nobody was injured in the incident, JetBlue Airways said. The aircraft's nose in the air and front landing gear are seen hanging while the plane is parked at a jet bridge, in video posted online. At least one opened cargo door in the front half of the plane can be seen. JetBlue is <strong>“reviewing this incident”</strong> and the plane will be inspected before flying again, the airline said. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which oversees the airport, said the incident did not disrupt any other operations at JFK.</p>
